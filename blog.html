A particularly bad form of empiricism which also brings to light its inherent flaws is given by the following attitude. "Knowledge" is ascribing probabilites to events, states of affair or propositions. In function of the data we progressively collect, this "knowledge" is then revised by applying the same kind of linear transformation (or integral). Somehow then, or so the Bayesian story goes, our hypotheses become more certain. This model is dubious. The progress of physics, in which new data was as vital as new theory was to obtain the said data - was achieved through striking qualititative leaps and creative discontinuities, involving in a necessary way the deployment of ever more complex mathematical concepts held to be absolutely certain in their domain of applicability. This process - which is at the heart of all advance in natural science - is irreducible to, and extremely far removed from applications of a uniform algorithm to formalised probabilistic belief systems and data sets. Mathematics - or its more fundamental domains such as arithmetic - is the most certain of sciences. We can speak of plausibilities and heuristics at a meta-level discussing certain axioms and sure, there can be experimental-computational approaches to certain problems. We can even develop systems of probabilistic logic, but only according to a non-probabilistic meta-theory. But to ascribe probabilities to arithmetical propositions and somehow claim to deploy deduction (and should not the rules then be probabilistic too?) is plainly absurd. Consider: there is a 80 percent chance that each number admits a unique factorisation into prime numbers, so there is a 70 percent chance that there are infinitely many primes. But look, I found this awesome new giant prime number so let us revise this to 75 percent ! The concept of probability is itself obscure and calls for analysis and elucidation. It is certainly not a key to epistemological problems or the philosophy of science. Probability is either an obvious property of a collection of data - and has nothing to do with chance or belief or certainty - or else an a priori arithmetical property of the state space of a combinatoric system - and has nothing to do with chance or belief or certainty. In conclusion: the progress of science and human knowledge is not about passively adjusting in a linear, mechanical way our theories to the evidence but about creatively interpreting new evidence in such a way that we can effect discontinuous leaps in the completeness and sophistication of our theories. This in turn leads us to ask nature new questions which can be answered with new meaningful data. This is also how living organisms relate, actively and creatively "adapt" to their changing environment. The advancement of knowledge is not about progressively "adjusting" the parameters of a fixed framework to optimise its relationship to the data (as in machine learning, or in the myth of beneficial genetic mutations) but primarily about extending in radical ways the framework itself or overhauling it completely. Another major point is that if scientific theories are axiomatic systems then the process of deducing consequences of those theories or proving their consistency is also non-linear and often not even computable.
<br>
If we want to relate combinatoric games such as Chess and Go to the concept of intelligence then the computational resources have to be factored in. It is not a question of simply winning or losing, for a massive machine operating at supra-luminal speed doing a brute force search has almost zero intelligence and yet would beat all human and machine players known at present. Also what about the concept of cheating ? Is it fair or even interesting if the computer can "cheat" and the human can't ? If a Chess player stopped the game to look up a game in a book or ran another program, would this not be cheating ? This ruling out of cheating expresses a restriction on resources.
Doing much with little, being creative, this is a reflection of true intelligence in this context of finite combinatoric games. 
We can recall also the remarks of Bobby Fischer against play based on mere memorisation. For resources we can consider the typical space and time measures used in structural complexity theory. We can certainly measure the size and number of training sets and iterations used by Alpha Go as well as the resources used during play. For the human player, playing well, we can calculate the number of games ever played or studied, obviously incomparably less. But there is no evidence of unusual intense neural activity - i.e. use of resources - during the play that could correlate with intense conceptual strategic thinking. The resources of the human mind seem to be residually small. Hence the performance and intelligence of the human mind in games such as Chess and Go is vastly superior to programs based on machine learning.

       Philosophy never should accept unexamined assumptions or if this is the case it should be done explicitly. Historically the value of the work of the greatest philosophers
       depends very little on the particular scientific hypotheses which they either accepted or proposed. Be this as it may, there is no excuse for a philosopher to
       implicitly or dogmatically accept theories which are clearly confronted with problems of internal consistency and rigour and empirical contradiction. 
       Benatar certainly offers some purely philosophical arguments and raises very interesting questions on how ethical propositions regarding an individual can be understood
       before the individual's birth or counterfactually. However we must be careful that "pessimism" is well defined and based on argumentation and the facts of experience
       and not on dogmatically accepting certain dubious or inconclusive myths and beliefs which have also been styled "pessimist". Examples are darwinism (some antinatalists
       even like to appeal to "selfish genes") or assuming without explicit argument that consciousness cannot continue after the death of the body or even preceed it. 
       Thus there is a danger that Benatar's arguments may have serious shortcomings. However consider Schopenhauer's non-darwinist biological ideas which are still very
       relevant as well as his interest in spiritualism, the facts concerning which are at least worth studying. In conclusion Benatar's dogmatic physicalist pessimism does
       raise interesting questions and the general spirit of his conclusions is not in itself undermined by his dogmatism.<br><br>

           There is preventive justice, there is corrective justice (a cathartic justice that desires the good, the improvement of the offender), a "retributive" justice (in the sense
           that a thief must return the goods stolen) and a cosmic justice in the sense that a consequence of certain acts comes in virtue of impersonal laws. 
            But vindictive justice in whatever measure or law is a monstrosity and abomination, it is the kind of "justice" that bloodthirsty tyrants exert against those
           that go against their will, a will set above universal moral laws and human rights. It represents that most abject and lowest state of human culture, a culture
           dominated and measured by violence and and fear rather than by intellect and compassion. 
           And yet, how many organised religions have not patterned their deities and their punishments on such monstrosities, their gods made in the likeness of cruel tyrants ?
           How can organised religions claim the right to be respected ? How can they not fall into the most gross contradiction to excuse all this with a kind of
           evolutionary theology ?  Back then it was understandable to consider the Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus, but no now, of course !
           The Christian Church does not make mistakes...it just "evolves"...or rather, since Constantine, wraps itself around the "powers that be". As for their sacred texts,
           it is no use sprinkling some fine moral sugar in a cup of poison, it is still poison. God is love, forgive your enemies...but believe this, submit to our organisation, or else.
           Organised religions, Communism, Nazism, many ancient Cultures (particularly those that involved slavery) 
           are essentially the same in denying the universality of the moral law and human rights, in putting something else above intelligence, virtue and compassion.
           The Nazi, the Nietzschean, the Alt-Right Neopagan, the Catholic Traditionalist and the Evangelical
            share so much in common. For instance, pro-natalism, homophobia, misogynism, exclusivism, demonisation of the other, justification of cruelty and violence and the relativization or negation of human rights 
            and a universal moral law applicable to both man and god.<br>
            
           
            There has been much talk of race and racism for the last two centuries, but what is racism ? Talk of genetically conditioned superiority ? But superiority with regards to something real or some kind
            of fairy-dust magically making a certain group "special" and "chosen" ? And if it is superiority with regards to something real, this of course implies that we have taken this
            something as superior, that is, we are begging the question. Without addressing the question: what are the most desirable, the most superior human traits, abilities and acomplishments,
            any "racism" is just irrational drivel, or, as we like to say today, mere "hate". And granted that what is "superior" has been determined - and this is the question that you
            must ask any "racist" - there follows the massively difficult problem of linking or correlating such traits - more or less intrinsically - with well-defined historical 
            genetic elements. A curious thing about human beings is that science fiction about the future is often more accurate than the kind of fantasy and speculation we enjoy about
            the prehistoric past, from Darwinian fairy-tales to a Gimbutas-style agricultural and matriarchal golden age. Yes, ten thousand year old cherry-picking is fun. The Nazis had
            a whole school of archaeology based on this.<br>
            Anyhow, I look at the past and I ask: what peoples or races have produced the most just and humane laws that did not involve slavery ?
        What peoples or races were the most compassionate, self-controlled, temperate and generous and had greatest insights into their own minds ?   
             What peoples or races produced the most mathematicians, logicians, philosophers, scientists, poets, artists and engineers ? What peoples or races had the greatest sense and feeling for the beauty of nature ?
            What races of peoples cared the most about animal rights, as the Pythagoreans and some early Neoplatonists did, unlike the vicious Roman vivisector Galen ?
            A race or people or culture that measures itself through its violent, brutal conquest, subjugation and destruction of other peoples or nations or the accumulation of material wealth
            or that romantically idolises such in the past is clearly inferior. The soldier or warrior as a defender of something precious certainly commands respect and many
            virtues may be described as warrior-like, transposed into a spiritual plane, just as intellectual work can be likened to exploratory adventure.
            But the defender cannot be placed above what is defended without becoming the aggressor. And how could wealth have any intrinsic relationship with someone's worth, qualities or 
            ability ? If the truly worthy man is gifted with wealth it honours the giver not the man that is gifted.

             The modern world is perhaps the most delusional of all worlds. <br><br>

             What society believes that human rights, freedom and justice somehow are just handed to you on a plate
             and do not require sacrifice and to be fought for ?<br><br>

             What society believes - contrary to the testimony of history - that somehow speaking the truth 
             and rational dissent will be automatically welcomed by the reigning consensus ?<br><br>

             Wake up ! Organised religion with all its anti-historical lies, psychological poison
             and superstitions is still here ! Totalitarian communism is still here ! <br><br>

             The Roman Catholic Church mislead and deceived the world through fake reformation in the 60's (The Vatican II Council).
             It convinced the world that the Roman Church has somehow become more enlightened, open, rational, humane and progressive, 
             when in reality, the result was (perhaps due to the elimination of the progressive movement at the time of the advent of Pope
             John Paul II) a superficial cosmetic surgery and brilliant publicity stunt covering an organisation rotten to the core. 
             An organisation that has taken permanently its "oath against modernism" continuing its age-long Jesuit and (and recently Opus Dei)
             assault on humanity,  poisoning the human spirit, debasing women and
             destroying the lives of children and young people. This stunt gained the Vatican an undeserved
             respectability which also took advantage of the modern phenomenon of the erasure of history and memory
             and the discarding of systematic critical scientific modes of inquiry into history and documents.<br><br>

             Communist China has massive resources and military power to back it up. Catholicism - the Google of Organised Religion -
             depends on nothing more than childhood indoctrination, ignorance, superstition, mental instability, social pressure, financial
             dependence and fear. And yet Communism is remarkably similar to Christianity in many ways. One striking similarity is 
             that both blood-stained  totalitarianisms deal with a social historical myth and at the same time depend of the ignorance of the
             genuine facts and documents of history. And both have never let human rights and critical analysis stand in their way.<br><br>

             Everything good in Christianity is either stolen or found (often in a purer form) in previous non-Christian (and non-Jewish)
             sources. And what happiness and joy it is to find morality, a path of spiritual cultivation, introspection and logic, in their pure original form, 
             at once so ancient and so modern ! If one cannot go directly back to the morality and scientific spirit of the schools of Pythagoras, 
             Democritus, Plato,  Aristotle, the Megarians and Stoics, Sextus Empiricus, to the original Samkhyan, Nyaya, Buddhist and Hermetic texts,  
             then one can at least study the great writers such as Shakespeare and Dickens and philosophers such as Kant and Schopenhauer who
             have extracted what is morally pure and culturally progressive from the heap of corruption of Christianity.

 Some important topics:<br><br>

 Animal rights. Against exploitation of animals, in particular against the use of animals in scientific experiments.<br><br>


 Human rights. The key qualities of compassion, forgiveness, humility, gratitude, global awareness, generosity.<br><br>

 Human beings should be grateful and aware of the good things they have such as health, safety and enough to eat. They
 should be keenly aware of the existence of people who do not even have these basic goods and thus curb their greed.<br><br>

 Central issues:<br><br>

 Overpopulation.  Does environmentalism that does not make overpopulation a central issue deserve consideration ?
 Hindering the addressing of the overpopulation problem is one of the worst crimes of organised religion.<br><br>

 Waste, luxury, ingratitude and extravagance in some places of they world and poverty, faminine, misery, war in others.<br><br>

 Against the tech giants. Those who use their services implicitly condone their ideology, their system of censorship and
 their violation of the privacy of the individual.<br><br>

 Have modern feminist movements lost their original meaning and legitimate purpose ? Feminism should focus
 on the problems of non-western countries. <br><br>

 Intellectual pursuit as a good in itself, having nothing to do with personal gain or profit. False, forced, unhealthy
 competition and flawed ways of comparing and evaluating people and things.<br><br>

 Science and Religion: it only takes a modicum of basic humanity and morality, a modicum  of critical 
 historical analysis of texts and documents, a modicum of the the most basic knowledge concerning the physical world
 and human biology and psychology, to find a massive amount of evidence, documents and arguments utterly fatal to the
 claims and dogmas of the major organised religions, specially in their literal, exclusivist sense.<br><br>

 Darwinism is not only bad science but has negative social and cultural impact. Darwinism is only
 one form of evolutionism. To equate or confuse darwinism with evolutionism is profoundly dishonest and a sign
 of bad faith covering a lack of any real argumentation.<br><br>

 Is it not utterly insane that (explicit or covert) apologists for traditional organised religions somehow
 think that darwinism is a key issue, forgetting the massive amount of fatal problems that their historical religions and sacred
 texts already face ? Merely a careful, calm, unprejudiced reading of their sacred texts and a basic knowledge of the
 culture of the time, is enough to bring forth a great multitude of fatal problems and contradictions.
 And do not all ancient peoples and cultures have their creation myths ? Why should the falsity of
 darwinism somehow favour Christianity rather than, let us say, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Neoplatonism, Gnosticism or some Indiginous culture ?
<br><br>
 This shows that these apologists care nothing about truth and argument, but rely of the status quo and social power of their
 religious cults.<br><br>

 What is wrong about thinking that ancient myths and legends (including the Jewish mythology contained in the Bible) might
 convey important scientific truths ? And surely there are more complex and interesting myths than the rudimentary Biblical
 ones, which might be far more scientifically suggestive ? The falsity of darwinism is not in itself favourable to theism or 
 even to the discarding of physicalism, as there are interesting materialist Lamarckian theories that should be 
 better known and which fit modern evidence and discoveries at least better than darwinism. In Buddhism, a non-theistic religion, 
 there is a a creation myth in the Aggañña Sutta of the Digha-Nikaya. We can imagine demiurgic beings, extra-terrestrial genetic engineers, 
 that may have influenced the evolution of life on earth. Or better, we can conceive  the evolution of life as a manifestation of an
 organisational information-increasing force in nature (alongside gravity, the electro-weak and strong forces) 
 obeying mathematical laws analogous to those of theoretical physics. All this has nothing to do with the theism of organised religions.<br><br>

 Darwinism is an unscientifc Western origins myth, and an ugly one, tied to some of the worst deeds of the
 Western colonialism, not to mention certain race theories.
 To somehow slander a non-darwinist or anti-darwinist as having anything in common with "creationist" apologists for organised
 religions is utterly despicable  and dishonest. This is made even worse by the fact that such apologists are extremely
 sly and cunning and often wear the mask of legitimate scientific dissent. This seems to be the case of
 the "Intelligent Design" movement, although there are (or were) a handful of good authors associated with this movement,
 which do not seem to be linked to organised religion.<br><br>

 It is sad that the most important works, the most devastating to darwinism but which cannot be so
 easily appropriated by creationists, are so very hard to get hold of ! Intelligent design authors who are
 clearly religious fundamentalists and have shut down the true philosophical and scientific spirit are not surprisingly very swift to
 dismiss other non-darwinist theories. The story is not: darwinism is false so let's shut down reason and call in faith (As Behe's books
 seem to insinuate), but rather: let us awaken reason and therefore reject both darwinism and organised religion, both faith-based systems.<br><br>

 This is another major issue: Constantinean Christianity with its two forms of Protestant Fundamentalism and Roman Catholicism
 have been gaining massive power and influence in the West, and they appear to have a special understanding (a kind of Concordat)
 with social media (Wikipedia in particular) and a certain famous search engine.
 The West has managed to undo centuries of progress. We have reached a state in which the Vatican plays
 the freedom of expression card against an Italian law against homophobia ! Freedom of expression ? Roman Catholicism ? I guess 
 more than a thousand years of the history of the Catholic Church (and centuries of Protestantism) 
 have gone down the Orwellian memory hole. Organised religion (like cults in general) is based on the negation of historical fact and evidence.<br><br>

 Both organised religion and capitalism seem to have merged in a Hegelian way with socialism.
 Genuine "scientific" socialism Bertrand Russell style, that is, hegemony of the global technocratic elite.<br><br>

 Darwinism and organised religion are equally an assault against human dignity, human ability, human reason, morality and freedom !<br><br>

 We need to make available crucial anti- and non-darwinist books and articles which have nothing to do with religious
 apologists. We need to make available historical critical studies of organised religions which are not tied to darwinism 
 or other modern pseudo-scientific myths such as transhumanism. Some of the earliest and more acute anti-Christian authors
 were Platonists, as were the earliest defenders of animal rights.  We need a secular (i.e. anti-theocratic) humanism which is 
 focused on the key philosophical and  moral points regarding human and animal rights, democracy and social progress and which is
 impartial with regards to any particular scientific theory.<br><br>

    It is important to actively combat the religious right without adopting (as some sites do) 
    the equally unscientific superstitions of transhumanism and darwinism.<br><br>

    Feminism, in its original historical sense, is still very important for non-Western countries, in which women
    do not share basic human rights and equality before the law and equal opportunities for education and jobs.<br><br>

    What we discuss here is the false "toxic feminism", that is, the feminism focused on or over-represented by privileged women 
    in economically developed Western countries where historical feminism has already achieved its aims.<br><br>

    SPOT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT:<br><br>

    Grant: Helmut Veith Stipend for Male Master's Students in Computer Science - Scholarship for men in mathematics/computer science 
    Annual Deadline: November 30<br><br>

    The VCLA invites applications for the Helmut Veith Stipend from motivated and outstanding male master's students who plan to pursue 
    one of the programs in Computer Science at TU Wien taught in English in one of the following semesters:<br><br>

    - winter semester 2021/2022<br>

    - summer semester 2022<br><br>

    This is real. Only the minor detail Female > Male,  Women > Men.  What happened to the original goal of GENDER EQUALITY 
    and GENDER NON-DISCRIMINATION ?<br><br>

    This should be ILLEGAL !<br><br>

    Feminism shoots itself in the foot. If girls have the same ability as boys in mathematics then why do we have<br>

    <a href="https://www.egmo.org">The European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad</a> ?! <br><br>

    Would it not be more in spirit of genuine feminism to have a Saudi Arabian or Iranian or African Girl's Mathematical Olympiad ? This
    to help girls and women overcome their insecurity due to adverse social pressure and lack of equal opportunity.<br><br>

    But pro-female gender discrimination in Austria ??!!!<br>
    Well, I guess, with countries such as Hungary and Poland regressing to a religious right-wing theocracy,
    Austria may well follow and need some genuine feminism again...<br><br> 

    O wait, is clear, objective, rigorous, logical thinking somehow too "masculine"  ?<br><br>

    Is there anything more absurd, hypocritical and discriminatory as "Coding Camps for Girls" in such places as Europe or the U.S. ?<br><br>

    "Coding Camps for Girls" are DISCRIMINATORY and should be ILLEGAL !<br><br>

    There is the following book published in 2003: <br><br>


    Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - and How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men by Biddulph, Steve<br><br>


    Now imagine the following book:<br><br>


    Raising Girls: Why Girls Are Different - and How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Women<br><br>


    Neither boys nor girls are "different", personality and character and ability are not determined by sex chromosomes.<br><br>


    An important (and we would argue the most important) part of the classical ideal of manhood was being SPIRITUAL, INTELLECTUAL and ARTISTIC,
    as manifest in countless men of genius who helped build human culture and civilization.<br><br> 
     Is transgenderism really an innate desire or need to surgically alter one's body rather than a symptom of socially imposed gender-norms
    and stereotypes ? Does not the concept of transgenderism imply that there are psycho-spiritual concepts of masculine and feminine ?<br><br>

    And just how does feminism relate to the problems of transgenderism ? <br><br>

    What is wrong with a male having a perceived feminine (or androgynous, gracile) body, personality and sensibilities ? Why is this viewed as
    an occasion for a "transition" rather than something fine and good in itself ?<br>
    We need to weed out some rotten aspects of Western culture, such as the (historical) use of the derogatory term "effeminate" implying
    that women were more inclined to sensual pleasures and luxury, and to moral weakness.<br><br>
 
    Cannot a man be virtuous, honest, highly intellectual and  feminine ? Both biological
    males and females display in fact ample polymorphism in body-types and psycho-somatic profiles. Who dictates which is to be the ideal
    or  most attractive ?<br>

    It is very important to study this topic in different times, places and cultures.<br><br>

    In 20th-century Cinema we can see the male star - departing from the classical slender-built spiritual ideal (no more like my
    father than I to Hercules !) -  progressively devolve into becoming larger, more muscular, brutish, one-dimensional and testosterone charged.<br><br>

    And this is also forgetting that a large muscular hyper-masculine looking man can easily be extremely sensitive and caring
    and interested in intellectual pursuits.<br><br>

    Problematic feminists would reduce all men either to the grotestque caricature of being stupid and violent or
    else to useful passive and submissive types. It is women who now somehow usurp the traditional male role of being
    intellectual, creative or natural leaders. <br><br>

    Just consider the following super-heroine fantasy movies and series, which are imbued with a 
    unsubtle and unsophisticated uniquely 21st-century feminism. All (or almost all) of the main female characters are white.<br><br>

    Halt and Catch Fire (women are natural tech geniuses)<br>
    The Queen's Gambit ( women are natural chess champions)<br>
    Westworld (transhumanist feminism)<br>
    The Handmaid's Tale (1984 in which men take over)<br>
    Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (girls and women assume the rule of the universe and boys and men are either evil and stupid or exist
    for their romantic fantasies or else are useful submissives)<br>
    The Society (the perfect feminist propaganda)<br>
    The Game Shakers (Children's series. Focused on a genius nerd girl and a leader-type girl.
    The males are either retarded (the blond boy) or clowns.)<br>

    MODERN FEMINISM SHOULD EITHER BE FOCUSED ON NON-WESTERN WOMEN OR CEASE TO EXIST AT ALL.
    MODERN FEMINISM SHOULD BE ABOUT EQUALITY and UNDERSTANDING, not VILIFICATION of the OTHER and PROPAGANDA.<br><br>

    We will have achieved progress when we realise that one's biological gender says nothing about one's personality, abilities, preferences or morality.<br>

    People should strive to be human beings first, and male or female afterwards.<br>
