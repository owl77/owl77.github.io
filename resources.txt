Nondeterministic Turing Machines and Evolution
The transition function of a nondeterministic machine produces a finite number of possible next computation steps. 
 These possible next steps are like random mutations or genetic combinations. Halting without accepting is not
  being able to survive/function.  An accepting state means a successful evolutionary step.

Stop Experimentation on Animals
Injecting cocaine in rats, dogs and monkeys must be stopped. Animals do not need to be sacrificed for humans.

β-PEA was also as effective as amphetamine in its ability to produce conditioned place preference (i.e., the process 
by which an organism learns an association between drug effects and a particular place or context) in rats (Gilbert 
and Cooper, 1983) and was readily self-administered by dogs that had a stable history (i.e., consisting of early 
acquisition and later maintenance) of amphetamine or cocaine self-administration (Risner and Jones, 1977; Shannon 
and Thompson, 1984). In another study, high concentrations of β-PEA dose-dependently maintained responding in monkeys 
that were previously trained to self-administer cocaine, and pretreatment with a MAO-B inhibitor, which delayed β-PEA 
deactivation, further increased response rates (Bergman et al., 2001). However, other studies have revealed an opposing 
action of TAs on brain reward. In rats that responded at threshold levels for intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the 
lateral hypothalamus, tryptamine antagonists not only caused dose-related increases when given alone but also potentiated 
the facilitating effects of amphetamine (Silveira Filho and Graeff, 1977).

Effect of ancient population structure on the degree of polymorphism shared between modern human populations and ancient hominins
https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/35/13956.full.pdf

In this paper it is explained how ancient population structure and common inheritance rather than hybridization account for 
genetic overlap between modern and extinct so-called "archaic" humans.

Re-Examining the “Out of Africa” Theory and the Origin of Europeoids (Caucasoids) in Light of DNA Genealogy
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f0f6/315c33b3c490706d8c7612a780f74a3f0f22.pdf

From (p.85):

"We believe that those arguments upon which the “Out of Africa” theory was based were, in fact, conjectural, incomplete and not 
actually data-driven. Therefore, we are left holding the question of the origin of Homo sapiens. Based on palaeoarchaeological evidence,
 the region, where anatomically modern humans have likely originated, is comprised of a vast territory from Central Europe in the west 
 to the Russian Plain in the east to Levant in the south. Each of these regions is renowned for discoveries of the oldest skeletal remains
  of modern humans dating back to 42,000 - 44,000 ybp. To date, none of these sub-regions has clear and unequivocal advances in this regard."

David Stove, Darwinian Fairytales - Selfish Genes, Errors of Heredity, and Other Fables of Evolution (1995)
 An absolutely brilliant and devastating work on the pseudo-scientific extrapolations of darwinist theory beyond biology to the human sciences.

Michael Denton - Evolution, A Theory in Crisis (1985)
 
Ultimately the Darwinian theory of evolution is no more nor less than the great cosmogonic myth of the twentieth century. Like the Genesis based 
cosmology which it replaced, and like the creation myths of ancient man, it satisfies the same deep psychological need for an all embracing explanation
 for the origin of the world which has motivated all the cosmogonic myth makers of the past, from shamans of primitive peoples to the ideologues 
 of the medieval church.

The truth is that despite the prestige of evolutionary theory and the tremendous intellectual effort directed towards reducing living systems
 to the confines of Darwinian thought, natures refuses to be imprisoned. In the final analysis we still know very little about how new forms 
 of life arise. The "mystery of mysteries" - the origin of new beings on earth - is still largely as enigmatic as wehn Darwin set sail on the Beagle.

Enhanced Dendritic Compartmentalization in Human Cortical Neurons

https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)31106-1.pdf

Extract:

Human pyramidal neurons possess larger dendritic arbors than rodent and primate neurons, but their input-output properties remain unknown. 
Dendrites filter synaptic events as they propagate toward the soma; however, dendritic spikes can amplify local signals to overcome
 electrical compartmentalization. These opposing attributes enable dendritic compartments to perform local operations on their inputs
  (e.g., coincidence detection). Multiple functionally independent compartments, integrating different streams of information 
  (e.g., feedforward and feedback inputs) , could endow individual neurons with the sophistication of small computational networks.
